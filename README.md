# Flask-Website
I decided to build my personal website using Flask. I started out with Corey Shaefer's excellent tutorial series on Flask. I am now modyfing & adding features to make it my own. So far, I've added the ability to use Markdown to format blog posts. I have also been learning CSS to modify the appearance of the web app.
